This website contains a number of useful and survival-friendly machine for you to bring your Minecraft life to a whole new level. Soon you will find Redstone being a infinitely powerful tool instead of a simple mineral.
I wanna show you a different way to play Minecraft. Hopefully, that can gives you enough interest to dig through the massive amount of knowledge of Minecraft.

This website gives you the exact way of building every machine.(Schematics are also given for more complex machines) Also, in every article, I will give a simple explanation about how it works. To be clear, I'm **not** the devices' creator, and I will paste a link to the original creator (if possible). If you want to know the details, seeing the creator's explanation is definitely a good way.

By the way, most of the machines works in the latest version (currently **JE** 1.16.2) and almost all Java versions ,**NOT Bedrock Edition**

If there is anything wrong with this website or I made a wrong demonstration QwQ , plss feel free to contact me via email. My email address is `2279429006@qq.com`
