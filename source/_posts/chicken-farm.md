Food and a shelter are absolutely the first two things you should handle when starting a game in Minecraft.
Of courses, nobody want to spend their time hunting everyday when they're going to start a big project.
Today I'm gonna show you how to build a very simple but useful auto chicken farm which you can build at the very first stage of Minecraft.

## Prepare some materials

Here are all of the things you needs, which can be easily got through a few minutes of mining.
1xDispenser, 1xMinecart with hopper, Some Normal Blocks(Glass), 2xHopper, 2xChest, 1xSand, 1xStone(or other solid blocks)
1xslab, 5xRed stone dust
a redstone comparator and a redstone repeater (See below if you don't have quartz for comparators)
And a few eggs.

## Build it!

It's recommended to build this farm in the spawn chunks, so that it will keep working all the time.

First, place a large chest on the ground and a hopper pointing to the chest like this.

Then put the rail and minecart(with hopper) on top of the hopper.

You can remove the rail now.

Surround the minecart with glass and then put a sand block on top of the minecart.

You can see that they stuck together.

Next, put the dispenser and the slab like this and complete the glass wall.

Then extend the wall one block higher and pour lava in the center.

Put a hopper pointing to the dispenser and surround it with 2-block high glass wall.
Smash eggs until you get 2 chicken, the more chicken you have here, the more efficiency it will be.(you can feed them with grass seed, too)

Behind, build a small plantform like this. (Notice the stone)

![2020-08-29_10.51.51.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/08/29/HIVPKaslQOM5xXv.png)
Build the redstone circuit (Notice the comparator's position)

![2020-08-29_10.52.00.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/08/29/dO7k4bRMCxea1mH.png)
Now just wait the chickens to grow up and the system will start working.

## Explanation

The chicken on top lay egg, and the egg get into the dispenser. The comparator detects the egg in the dispenser and send a redstone signal.
The signal loop in the circuit, continually activating the dispenser to smash eggs until the dispenser is empty.

The chicken stand on the slab. When they grow up, they touch the lava and get killed, dropping cooked chicken and leather into the hopper and the chest.

If you don't want to go to the nether to obtain quartz, you can use redstone like this. That isn't too much different.
